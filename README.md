# Custom-Hash-Table
A custom hash table of a vector of lists with the use of a popular hashing function is created to retrieve movie data object and actor data in O(1) runtime. It uses linear probing to avoid overwriting data and resizes itself after a certain threshold is met. The program neatly displays movies and actors when the user asks for a query that fits the criteria.
